	<td>ABOUT US</br>
	Launched in 2019, Pillsite's main vision is to be the best preference of customers for their health, Started with the sole purpose of making healthcare accessible and affordable to all. We help patients connect with local pharmacy stores and diagnostic centers to fulfill their extensive medical needs. Many times, when we opt for conventional shopping, we tend to spend a lot more than planned and end up buying items that aren't exactly what we wanted (but we can't find anything better in the store). Online,we don't have to let the store's inventory dictate what you buy, and you can get exactly what you want and need.
 We believe that everyone should have access to good health. .</br></br>


We aim to revolutionize the healthcare system by: </br>

*  Only buy authorised medicines</br>
*  Making healthcare a universal right is our prime vision.</br>
*  Door delivery</br>

*  Eradicating fake medicines which contribute 30% of drug volume in India.</br>

*  Reducing drug dependency and drug abuse. </br>
*  Insist on information about the medicine.
